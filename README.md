## Announcements
I consulted with prof. Kamiński and points for our Tuesday competition are to be extra points. This means that maximum number of poins you can get from our labs is 50 and you can score that many form our final test. So if you lose any points on test, extra points for competition will be added - in other words your final score will be:  
`min(50, (test+competitions))`.  
Points will be given as follows:  
* 1st - 5 points  
* 2nd - 4 points  
* 3rd - 3 points  

And others will get one point for participation. :)
