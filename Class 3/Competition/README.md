# Competition  
Please download file `train_data.csv` which contains:  
* `Target` - dependant variable of interest (continuous) 
* `V1 - V17` - explanatory variables which are available to use


In this data set you have 666 observations to train your models.  
The aim of the contest is to train model and make most accurate predictions for observations stored in file `test_data.csv`, containing further 111 observations.

You can work in pairs (but pairs only). Each pair has 3 tries to submit their predictions. Only the best prediction is taken into account. Models will be evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE). Pair who submits model with the lowest MSE wins. If two models have the same MSE, one submitted earlier is considered to be better.  

To submit your predictions please send me the file with vector of length 111 with predictions in order as in file `test_data.csv`. Please use `.csv` format. Send your submission on my e-mail: nosarzewski.aleks@gmail.com with name of your group and number of submission in message subject.  

I will try to evaluate your models on the go and provide you with with leaderboard.  

Points will be given as follows:  
* 1st - 5 points  
* 2nd - 4 points  
* 3rd - 3 points  

And others will get one point for participation. :)
