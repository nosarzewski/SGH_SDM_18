# Regarding code not working during our classes
I revieved codes prepared and there seems to be a problem with a version of R/RStudio we have installed in room B12 (which is out-of-date).  
If your plots are messed up after adding legend, just skip it.  
Regarding selecting variables based on significance of correlation I checked code both on Mac and Windows and it works, provided that you have up-to-date versions of R & RStudio. Since we were not able to cover this durig our classes, I will not be expecting you to know it, but it is a good idea to run this code on your own for the sake of exam.
